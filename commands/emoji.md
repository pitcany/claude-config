😊 Add appropriate emoji to the content we're working on to make it more engaging and easier to scan.

$ARGUMENTS

## 📍 Placement
- Add emoji at the beginning of headers before the text
- Include emoji in lists and navigation elements
- Code comments

## 🔄 Two-pass approach
1. First pass: Add the most fitting emoji for each element

# 🎯 Patterns for consistency
- Match emoji to content's tone and purpose (🎉 celebrations, 🔧 technical, 📚 documentation)
- Use emoji for status indicators (✅ complete, ⏳ in progress, ❌ error, ⚠️ warning)
